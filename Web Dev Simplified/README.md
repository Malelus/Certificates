# [Web Dev Simplified](https://courses.webdevsimplified.com/)

`"My name is Kyle and I have been a full stack web developer since 2015. I have a Computer Engineering degree, but am mostly self-taught when it comes to web development. Because of this I am able to leverage both my formal education as well as my experience as a self-taught developer to create the most comprehensive and easy to understand courses available. I also run the YouTube channel Web Dev Simplified with over 1 million subscribers."`
